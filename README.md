## Project Overview

This is a responsive **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **nine core image-processing algorithms**.  
Each algorithm features both **simple** and **advanced** versions for educational and practical exploration, where applicable.

---

## Key Features

- Nine essential image processing algorithms
- Responsive, interactive user interface
- Modular and maintainable codebase
- Real-time previews and dynamic algorithm switching

## Project Requirements and Rules Summary

- **Frontend** development uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Teams** consist of 1â€“3 students; each team maintains a GitHub repository.
- Each algorithm is implemented on a separate page.
- Some algorithms have both simple and advanced versions; others only simple.
- Algorithms include:
  - Image Rotation (simple: multiples of 90Â°, advanced: arbitrary angles + frame fix)
  - Color Correction/Filters (minimum 3 distinct filters; advanced: algorithmically different filters)
  - Image Scaling (simple scaling; advanced: anti-aliasing)
  - Image Segmentation (simple geometric shapes; advanced: complex contours using OpenCV.js)
  - Spline Interpolation (broken lines to splines; advanced: adjustable convexity)
  - Retouching (area marking and fixing)
  - Unsharp Masking (fixed ratio sharpening)
  - Bilinear/Trilinear Filtering (point-based transforms)
  - 3D Cube Projection (D6 cube; advanced: user-selectable faces)
