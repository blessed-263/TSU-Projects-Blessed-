## Current Project: Web Development and Image Processing

**Team Name:** RIDING-SOLO  
**Member:** Blessed Panashe Nyathi  
**GitHub Repository:** [TSU-Projects-Blessed-](https://github.com/blessed-263/TSU-Projects-Blessed-)

### Project Overview
A web application implementing 8 core image-processing algorithms, each with simple and advanced versions.  
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Key Features
- 9 image processing algorithms  
- Responsive user interface

### Algorithms Implemented (Status: Pending)
| Algorithm           | Simple Version             | Advanced Version                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Image Rotation      | 90° increments             | Arbitrary angles + frame fix       |
| Color Filters       | 3 basic filters            | 3+ algorithmic filters             |
| Image Scaling       | Basic scaling              | Anti-aliasing for large scales     |
| Image Segmentation  | Geometric shapes           | Object/people contours (OpenCV)    |
| Spline Interpolation| Broken → spline            | Adjustable convexity               |
| Retouching         | Basic spot fix             | Content-aware fill                 |
| Unsharp Masking    | Fixed ratios               | Custom kernel control              |
| Bilinear/Trilinear | Basic transform            | Dynamic scaling choice             |
| 3D Cube             | D6 cube                   | N-face selection (Three.js)        |
