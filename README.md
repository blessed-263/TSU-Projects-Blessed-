## Project Overview

This is a responsive **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **nine core image-processing algorithms**.  
Each algorithm features both **simple** and **advanced** versions for educational and practical exploration.

## Key Features

- Nine essential image processing algorithms
- Responsive, interactive user interface
- Modular and maintainable codebase
- Real-time previews and dynamic algorithm switching

## Project Requirements and Rules

- **Module 7** focuses on web development and image processing.
- **Frontend** must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Teams**: 1–3 students per team; each team maintains a GitHub repository.
- **Application**: Each algorithm must be implemented on a separate page.
- **Simple & Advanced**: Some algorithms require both simple and advanced versions.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Image Rotation**: Rotate image by multiples of 90°. Advanced: arbitrary angles and frame handling.
  - **Color Correction/Filters**: At least three distinct filters. Advanced: algorithmically different filters.
  - **Image Scaling**: Enter scale ratio. Advanced: anti-aliasing for large scaling.
  - **Image Segmentation**: Detect geometric shapes. Advanced: complex segmentation (e.g., contours), OpenCV.js allowed.
  - **Spline Interpolation**: Create broken lines, interpolate to splines. Advanced: adjustable convexity.
  - **Retouching**: Mark area to retouch.
  - **Unsharp Masking**: Apply with fixed ratios.
  - **Bilinear/Trilinear Filtering**: Specify points for transform. Use bilinear for enlarging, trilinear for shrinking.
  - **3D Cube**: Display and rotate a D6 cube. Advanced: user selects number of faces.
