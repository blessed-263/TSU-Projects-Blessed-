### Project Overview

This is a responsive **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **9 core image-processing algorithms**.  
Each algorithm features both **simple** and **advanced** versions for educational and practical exploration.

---

### Key Features

- 9 essential image processing algorithms
- Responsive, interactive user interface
- Modular and maintainable codebase
- Real-time previews and algorithm switching

### Algorithms

| Algorithm            | Simple Version   | Advanced Version                |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Image Rotation       | 90° increments   | Arbitrary angles + frame fix    |
| Color Filters        | 3 basic filters  | 3+ algorithmic filters          |
| Image Scaling        | Basic scaling    | Anti-aliasing for large scales  |
| Image Segmentation   | Geometric shapes | Object/people contours (OpenCV) |
| Spline Interpolation | Broken → spline  | Adjustable convexity            |
| Retouching           | Basic spot fix   | Content-aware fill              |
| Unsharp Masking      | Fixed ratios     | Custom kernel control           |
| Bilinear/Trilinear   | Basic transform  | Dynamic scaling choice          |
