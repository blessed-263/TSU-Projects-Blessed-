## 🌟 Project Overview

A responsive **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **8 core image-processing algorithms**, each with **simple** and **advanced** versions.

**Key Features**:  
✅ **9 algorithms** covering essential image operations  
✅ **Interactive UI** with real-time previews  
✅ **Responsive design** (works on desktop & mobile)  
✅ **Modular code** for easy maintenance

## 📅 Development Progress

### **Day 1**

- Created project repository and folder structure
- Drafted initial README.md
- Set up base HTML/CSS for the main page

### **Next Steps**

- [ ] Implement core algorithms (start with Rotation/Filters)
- [ ] Add interactive sliders/buttons for adjustments
- [ ] Optimize performance for large images
