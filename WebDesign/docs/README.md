## üöÄ Development Progress

### Day 1 (April 29, 2025)

- Created project repository and folder structure

### Day 2 (April 30, 2025)

- Drafted initial README.md
- Set up base HTML/CSS for the main page

### Day 3 (May 1, 2025)

- Created template HTML files for all algorithm pages (simple & advanced)
- Set up directory structure for simple and advanced algorithm implementations
- Added Font Awesome integration for UI icons
- Implemented navigation sidebar with dropdown functionality
- Created links between simple and advanced algorithm versions
- Established consistent styling across all pages
