# üì∑ Image Processing Web Application

**Module 7: Web Development & Image Processing Project**

**Team Name:** RIDING-SOLO  
**Member:** Blessed Panashe Nyathi  
**GitHub Repository:** [TSU-Projects-Blessed-](https://github.com/blessed-263/TSU-Projects-Blessed-)

## üåü Project Overview

This is a responsive **web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **9 core image-processing algorithms**, each on a separate page. Some algorithms have both **Simple** and **Advanced** versions, while others only have a Simple version.

The application features:

- ‚úÖ Implementation of 9 distinct image processing algorithms
- ‚úÖ Separation of algorithms into individual pages for modularity
- ‚úÖ Interactive UI with real-time previews and controls
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable, and modular codebase

## üìö Module 7 Project Rules Summary

- The project implements multiple image processing algorithms, each on a separate page.
- Some algorithms have simple and advanced versions; others only have simple.
- The team consists of 1-3 members and maintains a GitHub repository.
- Weekly progress presentations are required; failure results in penalties.
- Points are awarded for algorithm completion, UI/UX quality, and code maintainability.
- Final grading occurs at the module exam with point redistribution among team members possible.
- The project emphasizes responsive frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
