## üåü Project Overview

A responsive **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that implements **8 core image-processing algorithms**, each with **simple** and **advanced** versions.

**Key Features:**  
‚úÖ **9 algorithms** covering essential image operations  
‚úÖ **Interactive UI** with real-time previews  
‚úÖ **Responsive design** (works on desktop & mobile)  
‚úÖ **Modular code** for easy maintenance

## üìÖ Development Progress

### **Day 1 (April 29, 2025)**

- Created project repository and folder structure

### **Day 2 (April 30, 2025)**

- Drafted initial README.md
- Set up base HTML/CSS for the main page

### **Day 3 (May 1, 2025)**

- Created template HTML files for all algorithm pages
- Set up directory structure for simple and advanced algorithm implementations
- Added Font Awesome integration for UI icons
- Implemented navigation sidebar with dropdown functionality
- Created links between simple and advanced algorithm versions
- Established consistent styling across all pages
- Implemented Simple and Advanced versions of the Image Rotation algorithm

### **Next Steps**

- [ ] Implement other core algorithms (start with Filters/Scaling)
- [ ] Add interactive sliders/buttons for adjustments
- [ ] Optimize performance for large images
